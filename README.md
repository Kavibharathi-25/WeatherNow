WeatherNow is a simple and responsive web application that provides real-time weather information for any city.
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data based on user input.
The app displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, along with an appropriate icon to enhance user experience.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the interface is clean and mobile-friendly. 
JavaScript handles API integration and dynamically updates the content without reloading the page.
The app also includes basic error handling for invalid or empty city entries.
